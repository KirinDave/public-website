Anyone who knows me knows I love coffee. They know because nearly every
cup I drink, I make by hand using strange plungers or elaborate vacuum
vessels. I don't just drink it for the caffeine, I genuinely like the
taste of the coffee I prepare. When I explain to people how there are
different types of coffee and why I like to prepare them, they usually
don't understand why I'd do that much for "just coffee." Then they try
some of the coffee I make; most people understand after that.

I focus on brewed coffee in this guide (as opposed to espresso, which
is its own discipline). Brewed coffee is great to take up at home
for a few reasons:

1. The quality of the coffee can be quite high even with very basic
equipment.
2. The equipment that brewed coffee requires is inexpensive.
3. It's a lot easier to get a huge diversity of flavor without extra
effort with brewed coffee.

Still, a lot of people believe that making their own coffee would  daunting,
difficult, or too expensive. The reality is that it simply doesn't
take *that much* skill to make a competent cup. I've taken some of the
things I've learned about coffeemaking and put them into a simple
list, ordered by the impact it will have on your experience.

## 5 Steps To Better Coffee

### 1. Grind Your Coffee Freshly

It turns out that the worst thing we do with our coffee is that we
pre-grind it. When a coffee bean is ground, it is basically shattered
and all the flavor starts to seep out. If you leave it sitting
overnight this way (even sealed), all the compounds that give the
coffee flavor either seep away or get oxidized. The result is muddy,
boring, vegetal coffee.

So, the first order of business for getting better coffee is to get an
inexpensive conical burr grinder. You can get some pretty fancy
hardware with this, but for starters there are two good, inexpensive
choices.

1. A simple hand grinder. These are cheap, they do a surprisingly good
job (for brewed coffee's medium and coarse grinds), and they help you
gt in shape. You cannot use them to make a lot of coffee at once, but
that's generally not a problem when you're making coffee after first
light. I recommend [this model]()

2. An inexpensive electric grinder. You can go really deep down the
rabbit hole on this, but a lot of people have had great luck with the
[](), which costs less than $80 and is easy to find.

Once you have a good coffee grinder, grinding your coffee right before
you use it is pretty easy. Even with store-bought coffees you will
notice an immediate improvement in the quality of yor cup. Roasted
coffee goes stale much more slowly than ground coffee, so if nothing
else you can keep coffee longer.

### 2. Buy Fresh Coffee

Now that you're grinding your coffee freshly, it makes sense to get
fresh coffee. Most major cities in America have coffee roasteries now,
so look around and experment! You can also order bags shipped in from
fairly good roasters around the country.

This is the point where you'll probably start to notice a really big
quality difference between your coffee and the coffee you drink
everywhere else. Freshly ground, freshly roasted coffee is really a
lot better than what most poeple drink.

I reached this state and said to myself, "Gosh it's nice having a good
cup of coffee in the morning, but I sure do wish I could have this at
work too." It turns out that there's an easy way to do this.

### 3. Measure Your Coffee & Water

Once you're picking out freshly roasted coffee and grinding it at
home, you no longer have the benefit of using pre-measured coffee. You
have to worry about how much coffee you put in the pot: too much and
you're wasting coffee, too little and your coffee is an undrinkable
bitter desert.

Fortunately, it's pretty easy to figure this stuff out. Use a simple
gram-accurate kitchen scale (even inexpensive ones will do) and stick
to the simple ratio. When we make coffee, we are using water to
extract flavor from the beans. If we extract too little, our coffee is
watery and vegetal. Too much, and our coffee is bitter and
astringent.

It turns out that we can handle this problem by comparing relative
weights, which means we can use simple ratios. A good "safe" ratio to
start with is 15:1, meaning 15 parts water to one part coffee. For
example, if you want to make 400ml of coffee (2 cups), you'd use about
27g of coffee (to account for what you'll lose in the grinding). As
you get better at making coffee, you can try more aggressive ratios
like 1:17.5. For now, just focus on making better coffee.

### 4. Try Aeropressing Your Coffee

Now it's time to get into the fun coffee gadgetry. First of all, we're
going to ditch your drip machine. Sorry, but very few drip coffee
makers do a good job, and those that do often cost over $150. _We_, as
DIY coffee fans, are going to pay a fraction of that cost for a much
better result!

The Aeropress is a simple one-cup brewing method that is as much a kit
for experimenting with coffee as a tool for your morning ritual. It's
a small, light plastic cylinder that houses a plunger. People often
compare it to a [french press](), but it uses paper (or
[finely perforated metal]()) filters and thus results in a clarified
cup. It's inexpensive, easy and brilliant.

The instructions it comes with are adequate, but you also might want
to try the ["Viking/FourBarrell Method"]() that I detailed on
Quora. Excluding the time it takes to heat the water, the process
takes less than 4 minutes. It takes less time to make a cup of great
coffee than to wait for a whole carafe of mediocre quality.

If you've gotte this far, congratulations. You are now making better
coffee at home than you can buy in most cafes.

### 5. Try Simple Pour-Over Methods

Now that you've taken a dip into hand-brewing your coffee, you'll see
that it actually doesn't take much to get started. The next step are
pour-over methods, of which are are a two options that I think are
newbie-friendly:

#### The Ghetto Gold

You get a large mason jar and an inexpensive
[Ditting Swiss Gold #2 Reusable Filter]. Then you get a kettle that is
not awful ([the Hario Bun is popular]()). You grind your coffee the
same way you grind for aeropress, and pour over. It should take about
3 minutes for 27g coffee/405g water (you use a timer and pour slowly
and periodically). This method is inexpensive, easy, and produces an
interesting cup of coffee.

#### Chemex

Much can be said about the [design and history]() of the
venerable Chemex devices. They are more expensive and require
(inexpensive) disposable filters. There are a lot of tutorials for the
Chemex online, but in general you follow the same simple procedure;
for 27-35g of coffee you pour water at a 15:1 ratio and it should take
around 3-3.5 minutes.

A lot of people say Chemex produces their favorite variety of
coffee. There's a lot of merit to this, and the process is very
relaxed and fairly forgiving. If you want to have a method to make
coffee for two or more that can be as fast or as showy as you want,
the Chemex is a go-to method.

## Good Coffee Everywhere

You don't have to settle for bad coffee at home or at work. A good
coffee setup can cost less than $50 if you bargain-shop and it quickly
pays for itself if you frequent a local cafe (or, dare I utter it,
Starbucks). The only investment is your time, and I value the
5 minutes away from my desk that an afternoon aeropressing gives me.

What's so shocking about all this is that *these methods just aren't
that hard!* Making great coffee consistently is an art, but making
good coffee consistently is just being methodical.
