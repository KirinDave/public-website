Anyone who knows me knows I love coffee. They know because nearly every
cup I drink, I make by hand using strange plungers or elaborate vacuum
vessels. I don't just drink it for the caffeine, I genuinely like the
taste of the coffee I prepare. When I explain to people how there are
different types of coffee and why I like to prepare them, they usually
don't understand why I'd do that much for "just coffee." Then they try
some of the coffee I make; most people understand after that.

I think a lot of people like coffee, but evidence suggests they don't
really understand how to make good coffee. Many people have never
even tasted a good cup of brewed coffee, so they have no basis for
comparison.

## 5 Steps To Better Coffee

### 1. Grind your coffee freshly.

### 2. Buy Fresh Coffee

### 3. Don't Use A Drip Machine

### 4. Try Aeropressing Your Coffee

### 5. Try simple pour-over methods.
