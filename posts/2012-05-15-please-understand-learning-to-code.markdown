## Another Day, Another Argument

Another morning, another news tech cycle mired in the open-letter
style of debate. The subject? The ever-controversial Jeff Atwood's
latest blog post,
["Please Don't Learn To Code"](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/05/please-dont-learn-to-code.html),
in which he basically argues that writing software is neither a
universally applicable skill, nor should it be a goal unto
itself. Within mere moments, [hastily written](https://gist.github.com/0f61db65bbd2d2cb681a) [rebuttals](http://sachagreif.com/please-learn-to-code/) were
thrown online, arguing that being able to write software is
"empowering" and that it "conditions your mind".

Now, normally I stay aloof from this kind of argument. It's all sort
of arbitrary to me. I encourage people who want to learn to code and I
don't foist it on those who have no interest. But as I skimmed over
these slapdash rebuttals and then reread Atwood's argument, I noticed
something no one was mentioning.

Everyone seems to be pointedly ignoring the fact that some of our best
research suggests that _anywhere between 1/3 and 1/2 of all people
*cannot* learn to code._ And without that knowledge, this argument is
fundamentally uninformed and directionless

## Science Is Happening

If you set yourself adrift on the information sea and start googling
about, you'll find a ton of research with varying results. But I
rather like how our 2006-based-understanding of the problem is
summarized in
["The Camel Has Two Humps"](http://www.eis.mdx.ac.uk/research/PhDArea/saeed/paper1.pdf)
by Dehnadi & Bornat.

You should check out the paper, but let me pluck out part of the
conclusion for the sake of this discussion:

> population varies according to general educational attainment. It would seem, from our Middlesex

What does it mean? For starters, it means _programming is a special
skill_ and that its fundamental complexity is not necessarily rooted
in the "formal specification" part of the problem. Plenty of people
who would make great mathematicians are at best mediocre and awkward
programmers (and vice versa, if this author can be counted as an
example). It also suggests that programming is not a skill you can
pick up as part of another skill set. If you can pick it up at all, it
requires that you focus on it and learn it specifically.

This result was by no means uncontroversial. You can even find
[Alan Kay famously disputing the result](http://www.secretgeek.net/camel_kay.asp),
and he makes some interesting arguments. But a subsequent
[2009 meta-analysis](http://www.eis.mdx.ac.uk/research/PhDArea/saeed/SD_PPIG_2009.pdf)
and more rigorous  re-testing went a long way
towards suggesting that there is truth in the contention that some
people simply are not cognitively equipped to be software engineers.

It's also worth mentioning that the population these studies acted upon was a group of motivated college students actively participating in computer
science classes. They represent educated, motivated people who
presumably had many advantages growing up as a child. For people who
grew up poorly educated, poorly motivated, and poorly
nourished; could the distribution of people possibly be any better
than a 50/50 split of "can" and "cannot"?

## When You Can't Do What Everyone Should Do

Unless you are a hell of a hold-out dualist, you've got to admit that
a lot of what your mind is and is capable of doing is directly related
to the meat in your head. Our brains are marvelous learning machines,
but we all have our talents and our limitations.

To some extent, people arguing that learning to code is empowering and
helps improve your overall cognitive abilities are
spot-on. It _is_ empowering, it _is_ amazing to be the kind of person
who can craft a machine that can touch the lives of 10,000 people or
fundamentally re-architect human communication.

But in this demand that _everyone_ learn the skill (and the implicit assumption that
everyone can learn), we're telling people who simply may not be
equipped for the task that they can and should be able to do
something. I'm not sure if these authors have considered what a
frustrating scenario that lays out in front of perhaps as much as half
of modern society.

Most people, for whatever reason, cannot (or will not) learn to code.

## When You Can Do What Most People Can't Do

The flip side is that if you can write software, then you've come onto
a talent that is relatively rare. The market for programming ability
bears this out: demand and salaries are high for competent software
engineers, doubly so for the experienced.

But with this celebrity-profession status comes a fair amount of
responsibility. You're spending man hours in a way that most people
will never be able to. Are you spending them wisely? Is what you're
working on today *worth your time?* Step back from your deeply
ingrained and half-faked
[impostor syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome)
defense mechanism  and ask yourself this question objectively.

The truth is, if you can code you're in a relatively elite
class of people. If you can code well, you're in an extremely elite
class. Are you using your talent for things that matter?

## Therefore, Try

Bringing ourselves back around to the original argument, we have to
try and ask who's right? Jeff Atwood asks, "How would Mayor Bloomberg
be better served as Mayor by learning to write javascript?" Perhaps he would
not, but he might discover he could contribute to a field desperate
for competent bodies (if only indirectly).

Given how scarce programmers are, and how scarce the ability to
program seems to be, we probably would be best served by trying to
teach everyone to program. If 60% of the population cannot learn to
code, identifying and encouraging the 40% who can becomes critically
important as more and more of society becomes dependent upon computers
for their daily lives.

That said, if someone cannot or does not want to learn then begrudging
them that inability is unfair. They are probably not lazy, or stupid,
or unmotivated. They just don't have the equipment. It'd be as
unfair as saying I'm lazy because I'm not a world-class sprinter, even
though I lack the body type and have a turned hip that only major
surgery could correct.

Of course, it's probably more fun to argue back and forth without the
slightest grounding in reality. That's what the blogosphere does best,
after all.
