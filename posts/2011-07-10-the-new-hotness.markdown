description: Introducing a new blog to ignore.

So, this is my new blog. It's a fair question to ask me, "Why another
blog? Don't you already have [a tumblr](http://kirindave.tumblr.com)?"
Fair question. After a few longer blog posts, I got a lot of negative 
feedback on the style I used on tumblr for reading. 

It made me realize that there is a lot I do with tumblr that is just
link and media sharing which is good, but it might not be appropriate
for _everything_ I want to do. So I decided that this will be my other
outlet, where I publish and mirror things that require a less
hyperactive setting to read and understand.

(Oh, and also: editing tumblr styles is a huge pain in the ass.)

Right now I'm using [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) to publish
this. I'm going to keep it up on
[Github](https://github.com/KirinDave/public-website), but publish to
a S3 bucket. 

I'll continue to incrementally refine the style and capabilities of
the site as I get more comfortbale with Yesod and Hakyll. In the
meantime:
